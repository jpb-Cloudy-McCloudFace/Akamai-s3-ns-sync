terraform.tf    Bump default subnets high in CIDR range as it can confilct with default VPC ranges.
lambda to SQS   Single SQS FIFO group ID prevents ECS scaling as only 10 messages can be pulled at a time per group ID preventing parrallel processing of the queue. In the case of needing to upload
                thousands of S3 objects, scalling using parrallel uploads to Akamai over exact order is typically prefered (exact order is not guarenteed from S3 delivery to Lambda anyway). A FIFO
                SQS queue will help with exactly once delivery, as required when uploading large files (why do it twice?) and using a group ID to the EPOCH second will alow for multiple ECS tasks
                to run in parrallel processing the files, 10 at a time, that arrived in that second.
